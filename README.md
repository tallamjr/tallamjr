### About Me

Hi! My name is [Tarek](https://tallamjr.github.io/)

I enjoy exploring how latest techniques in statistical signal processing and
probabilistic machine learning can be used for **Learned Image Reconstruction**
and **Learned Image Compression** 🗜️ in <br> **Embedded Systems** for **Embedded
Machine Learning (#tinyML)** 📱

- 📺 I’m currently working on efficient algorithms and models for real-time AI-enabled video processing. Think efficient video reconstructions from sparse data.
- 🪁 I’m currently learning about [probabilistic machine learning for data compression](https://robamler.github.io/teaching/compress21/) and all things electronics to complement my on-device AI research.
- ⚡ I'm currently playing with [embedded `rust`](https://knurling.ferrous-systems.com/sessions/) for new embedded projects and continuing playing with [`polars`](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/) for all my big-data processing problems.
- 🔭 In a past life, I worked on [time-series classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06178) and [deep learning deployment through model compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08951.pdf) for problems in Astrophysics.
