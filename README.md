#### About Me

My name is Tarek Allam Jr,

![](http://www.tarekallamjr.com/blog/img/about/profile-pic-smile-square-crop.jpg)

I am a fourth year PhD student at the Centre for Data Intensive Science at University College London
(UCL). My research focus is on the application of **Deep Learning** algorithms for real-time
classification of Astrophysical transient events ðŸ”­

Whilst my academic research involves applying machine learning techniques to Astrophysical
time-series data, outside of this, I enjoy using similar techniques for time-series data from edge
devices, and learning how latest deep learning methods can be used in **Embedded Systems** for
**Embedded Machine Learning (#TinyML)** ðŸ“±
